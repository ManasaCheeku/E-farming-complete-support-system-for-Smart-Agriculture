Abstract: 

In our country, India's agriculture is the backbone of the country’s monetary development. In our county, 1/3 of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture plays a crucial role in human lifestyles. In our agriculture for crop prediction and yield prediction, the use of Machine Learning strategies has come to be more 
efficient. Yield prediction holds an important position in agriculture. Nowadays, all people beginning farming should recognize simple facts about the rural place, plants to be sown, and the necessities desired for agriculture. We are thinking about our historical records and related attributes, which include temperature, climatic situations, soil, and locality. For yield prediction, soil additionally plays a crucial role in 
farming. In this research study, we've proposed a system to help farmers with smart farming and agriculture. We have designed the machine to increase crop yield prediction with the use of machine learning strategies. We are predicting the yield of two major crops grown in our county, paddy and ragi, and we've gathered datasets from the Mysore agriculture department. This proposed
The device is designed to work as real-time software and is relevant for a couple of regions We are making use of supervised classification strategies consisting of KNN.
Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms, and those anticipated results are displayed in the form of a GUI.
